# Digital-Ads-Performance-Transformation-for-a-Fortune-500-Social-Media-Client-TCR-Innovation-
At TCR Innovation, I managed a digital advertising optimization initiative for one of our Fortune 500 social media clients whose in-app ad campaigns were facing declining engagement and rising cost-per-conversion. The client’s ads ran across multiple regions, and the sales organization needed a structured, predictable plan to improve ad performance before the next quarterly cycle.

To bring order and clarity, I created a PMI-aligned execution framework. I started by building a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that detailed every component of the project—audience research, funnel diagnostics, creative audits, A/B test design, analytics reviews, performance reporting, stakeholder syncs, and GTM enablement. I then converted this into a Gantt schedule outlining weekly milestones: data extraction, segmentation analysis, creative redesign sprints, experiment rollouts, mid-cycle reviews, and final KPI reporting. This helped engineering, analytics, and marketing teams coordinate effortlessly.

Once the project structure was set, I created a central performance database in Excel + SQL.
This database included:

_Audience segments (age, region, device, behavior clusters)
Creative performance (CTR, CPC, swipe-up rate, view-through rate)
Funnel metrics (impressions → engagement → conversion)
Budget allocation vs ROAS
Creative fatigue indicators
Ad placement level performance_

Using this database, I performed audience segmentation to identify where ads were underperforming. I found that certain regions had rising fatigue rates, CTR had fallen by 18%, and cost-per-conversion was climbing due to low relevance scores. Creative performance diagnostics also showed that repetitive visual templates caused users to skip ads quickly.

To validate improvement opportunities, I collaborated with engineering and ad operations teams, explaining which insights required platform-level adjustments—such as updating pixel tracking rules, fixing attribution inconsistencies, and enabling new ad placement formats. I communicated with them through structured weekly stand-ups, requirement briefs, and issue logs.

On the business and marketing side, I held weekly alignment calls with the sales, GTM, and performance marketing teams. I shared insights on which creatives resonated, which audience clusters were high-intent, and which segments were draining budget. I translated data into actionable storytelling: “what the customer wants,” “where drop-offs happen,” “what messaging works,” and “how to reposition the campaign to match user behavior.”

To test our hypotheses, I implemented rigorous A/B and multivariate testing cycles.
We tested variations of:

_Creative visuals
Copy length and CTA wording
Placement strategy
Short-form vs long-form layouts
Budget weighting across high-ROI regions
A/B testing was essential because the client lacked clarity on which creative combinations actually drove conversions. Testing provided evidence-backed insights rather than assumptions._

Meanwhile, I also handled daily business tickets submitted by sales, marketing, and engineering teams—such as tracking discrepancies, ad delivery issues, audience exclusions not working, placement errors, and creative rejection problems. I triaged, prioritized, and closed these issues through a shared ticketing and communication channel, ensuring campaigns ran smoothly.

By the final cycle, we delivered a clear, scalable GTM and optimization strategy:

Shifted budget to high-intent segments
Redesigned creatives for freshness and relevance
Improved delivery promise messaging
Refined targeting rules and negative filters
Provided a new sales playbook for advertisers
Developed a KPI dashboard for ongoing campaign reviews


**The impact was transformative:

1.CTR increased by 28%
2.Cost-per-conversion dropped by 22%
3.View-through rate rose by 19%
4.Ad fatigue decreased by 31%
5.Sales teams saw improved advertiser confidence and faster closes**

The new GTM strategy helped the client increase quarterly ad revenue from high-performing segments by 18% and the client retained—and expanded—their partnership with TCR Innovation because of the repeatable, PMI-driven optimization model I built for them.
